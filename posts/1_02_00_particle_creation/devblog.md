## Creation & Annihilation in the Causal Budget Framework (CBF)

**Normalization.** Per object we use a unit‑tick split, so the causal budget is normalized to
$$
T^2 + M^2 = 1 \quad \text{(unit causal budget per tick)}.
$$
Global conservation is enforced at each event by
$$
\sum_{\text{participants}} (\Delta T + \Delta M) = 0.
$$

### 1 · Creation (Mass from Motion)

A source region trades part of its translation share into maintenance for the new commit:
$$
T_{\text{source}} \to T_{\text{source}} - \Delta T, \qquad M_{\text{new}} = \Delta T,
$$
so that the total change across the event satisfies
$$
\Delta T_{\text{tot}} + \Delta M_{\text{tot}} = (-\Delta T) + (\Delta T) = 0.
$$
*Spatial gate caveat:* creation requires a **momentum partner** (e.g., nearby matter or a field interaction) to satisfy recoil. In standard units there is also a **threshold** (e.g., $E_\gamma \ge 2 m_e c^2$ for pair creation).

### 2 · Annihilation or Decay (Motion from Mass)

When a bound system decays or annihilates, stored maintenance is released as propagating translation in the products:
$$
M_{\text{old}} \to M_{\text{old}} - \Delta M, \qquad T_{\text{radiation}} = \Delta M,
$$
again obeying
$$
\Delta T_{\text{tot}} + \Delta M_{\text{tot}} = 0.
$$
*Spatial gate note:* multi‑product (e.g., two‑photon) channels ensure momentum balance in the collapse.

### 3 · Global Ledger Closure

Across all participants:
$$
C_{\text{tot}} = \sum_i (T_i + M_i) = \text{constant.}
$$
After the event, **each object** (source and products) resumes its own per‑tick identity:
$$
T^2 + M^2 = 1, \qquad \gamma = \frac{1}{M}.
$$
The first equation enforces per‑object kinematics (the Lorentz split). The second describes how each participant spends its budget during subsequent ticks.

---

### 4 · Photon Special Case

Photons carry $M = 0$ and exist entirely within the translation channel. During pair production **near matter**, a photon’s $T$ budget can be partially converted into $M$ for new massive particles while a partner absorbs recoil, preserving the event’s overall balance:
$$
\sum (\Delta T + \Delta M) = 0.
$$
*Temporal gate note:* there is **no temporal buffering on the photon leg**; buffering resides in the matter endpoints at emission/detection.

---

### 5 · Discrete Invariants

Beyond $(T, M)$ budgets, the Event Ledger’s Spatial/Directional gates enforce conserved quantum numbers (e.g., charge, lepton number). Creation/annihilation respects all ledgered invariants — not just energy‑momentum — ensuring consistent outcomes across commits.

---

**Summary.**  
Creation and annihilation are not separate mysteries in CBF — they are **budget reallocations** within the universal ledger. The Lorentz geometry ($T^2 + M^2 = 1$) governs per‑object ticks, while the event rule ($\sum (\Delta T + \Delta M) = 0$) guarantees global conservation.
