**The Causal Budget Framework: A Computational Theory of Everything**

Reality operates as a vast computational system where every particle emerges from a sphere of independent computational agents called wave cells. Each wave cell follows a simple constraint: within each computational tick, it can either translate through space, oscillate in place, or process internal maintenance, but its total activity is limited by a fixed causal budget where C = T(translate) + M(maintenance) = 1.

**The Architecture of Particles:**
Wave cells use their maintenance budget (M) to follow cellular automata-like rules that govern particle behavior. These rules allow wave cells to spawn new cells, diffract momentum, and heal into coherent formations, exactly what we observe in quantum mechanics like the double-slit experiment's self-correction. When unconfined, wave cells spread out and interact with thousands of atoms before any event finalizes. When compressed within atoms, they create the dense computational hubs and act as internal clockwork.

**The Event Ledger (Reality's Operating System):**
Since wave cells can interact with thousands of atoms before finalizing an event, the universe needs a global arbiter to choose which absorption actually occurs. The Event Ledger serves this role, managing all quantum collapses through a sophisticated four-gate reconciliation process. Rather than "first photon wins," the Ledger evaluates every potential event through:
- **Spatial reconciliation** compares position and phase at overlap points, where wave-cell oscillations naturally add or cancel, creating near-field “fingers” that mature into far-field interference bands.
- **Temporal synchronization** that produces relativistic effects when different reference frames must align
- **Directional alignment** to preserve rotational symmetry
- **Informational filtering** based on causal history, where quantum erasure and fine-tuning emerge

**Gravity as Computational Bottlenecking:**
In regions with many simultaneous signals, the Event Ledger develops processing queues, what CBF calls Queue Buffering. To maintain causality, the system compensates by reducing the local causal budget (C), slowing down all processes. This creates gravitational time dilation even at a distance.

**Curvature and Acceleration:**
When C decreases, it's not uniform across the particle - C is lower closer to the gravitational source and higher on the far side. This creates a gradient where wave cells at different positions within the particle sphere experience different computational constraints. To maintain coherence as a unified particle, the wave cells must renormalize their vectors to compensate for this C-gradient. This bends the particle's trajectory toward the gravitational source. The recursive nature of this renormalization, particles getting progressively more bent as they fall deeper into steeper C-gradients, produces the continuous acceleration we experience as gravity.

**Unified Explanations:**
This single computational framework explains phenomena that conventional physics treats as separate:
- **Photons** have zero maintenance budget (M = 0), so they propagate at maximum translation speed but cannot trigger events independently. **Matter particles** follow the same wave cell architecture but carry resting maintenance budgets (M > 0), allowing them to interact and collide.
- **Special and General Relativity** emerge from the frame-synchronization requirements in the Temporal Gate
- **Quantum mechanics** arises from wave cell interactions and the probabilistic Event Ledger
- **Dark Matter and Dark Energy** fall out naturally from the computational constraints
- **Maxwell's equations** describe wave cell field behavior

**Conclusion:**
The universe runs on directional computational time while particles experience proper time based on their T+M balance. What we call spacetime, gravity, and quantum mechanics are really the ledger events synchronized to the observer particles current frame.

In CBF, everything emerges from computational agents following simple budget rules, managed by an Event Ledger that ensures global causality while allowing local quantum flexibility.
